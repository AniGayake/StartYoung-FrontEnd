    It is a sad reality that many areas in the UK are poverty stricken, with many children and young adults going without the basic needs. A group of individuals came together to help and support local schools in East London with a Christmas Gifting Initiative in 2020.

The schools requested clothes and food rather than toys as certain children were coming to school with socks on their hands instead of gloves, and some with no under garments. This was a huge eye opener for us.

We were able to give over 400 parcels, which included , care packages and food hampers , underwear, socks, hats, gloves & scarves.

Families were struggling financially and with the impact of COVID-19, this made their daily living struggles even worse. Our main aim was to ensure those families who were disadvantaged and living in poverty were prioritised. It was apparent that this was an even bigger problem than we had initially anticipated and although the gifts were a help, these families needed long term assistance.
